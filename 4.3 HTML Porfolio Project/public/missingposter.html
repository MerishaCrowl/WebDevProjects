<h1>Have You Seen Isaiah Figueroa?</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Name: Isaiah Figueroa</li>
    <li>Age: 20</li>
    <li>Height: 5ft 9.5in Weight: Approx 200 lbs</li>
    <li>Hair: Dark Brown Eyes: Dark Brown</li>
    
</ul>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 400px;">This is the last time we saw Isaiah in person. He disappeared under very strange circumstances. Someone took over his phone and was pretending to be him. They continued sending his phone payments to me but did not know how much the bill was or the proper due date. Isaiah stopped using all social media, all known online accounts. Our family has been stalked, hunted, and repeatedly harmed for the last few years. We have run back and forth across the country trying to stay safe.</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 400px;">I have a lot of details surrounding his disappearance and other terrifying situations that have happened to us but I cannot get any person in authority to even speak to me. I'm very afraid Isaiah is no longer alive because I do not believe he would disappear for this long or to this extent. The last communication I believe was actually with him he stated he wanted to be with me and his little brother. Then he disappeared just a few days prior to his little brother's birthday. He has never responded to another message through any means again including pleas from his little brother asking if he was dead.</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 400px;">Isaiah would never do this willingly. It may be the entire world against me and I won't give up making sure my child is safe and if not get to the bottom of what happened to him. Someone out there has the ability and power to help me find him. Our family did not deserve to be punished for surviving. If you can help in any way or have any details please check this out and update or reach out. I will provide an email as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 400px;">Isaiah has no criminal history, he was a strong student, homeschooled with a strong work ethic. He made employee of the month with his second employer and rarely missed a day. Isaiah is a good person. With a big heart. We love him and we miss him and we are shattered at the fears of what has happened. If you are out there Isaiah please find a way to let me know you are okay or how to help you. If you know something please say something.</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 400px;">If I am completely wrong about the character of my son and you have willingly chosen to just never speak to us again for some unknown reason, that will break our hearts but I will respect that, but I will not accept that until someone in authority has physically laid eyes on Isaiah and spoken to him one on one to ensure he is okay and confirmed that with me. I do not need to know a single other detail about his whereabouts or anything else if someone will just please confirm physically that his is okay. Isaiah wouldn't do this. I absolutely do not believe he would do this to me let alone his little brother. He not once hurt us on purpose in 20 years. Not once did we have an issue where he would behave like this.</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 400px;">Something is wrong. Please help my family.</p>
